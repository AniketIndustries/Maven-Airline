Utilizing MS Excel, I conducted an in-depth analysis of airline passenger 
satisfaction, evaluating service ratings across demographics such as 
age groups and travel classes. The project involved dissecting insights 
into frequent travelers' preferences and disparities between economic, business, and premium classes. By uncovering actionable insights, 
the analysis aimed to aid the airline company in enhancing customer 
experience and strategic decision-making.
